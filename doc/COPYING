This code is GPL see LICENSE or <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Basically use it, extend it, learn from it, use it as toilet paper, I don't mind.

If you change it, It would be cool if you contribute the patches back to the community.

I don't make any promises about this working, compiling cleanly, or not summoning the dark lord.

Enjoy.
